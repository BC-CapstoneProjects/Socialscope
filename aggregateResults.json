Little guy isn\u2019t even a year old yet, but this has been something I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot. Stresses me out thinking how to navigate conversations with schools, peers, and family.\n\nUntil about 10 years ago, I didn\u2019t think twice about being a member at the San Diego Zoo, visiting the wild animal park, or Seaworld. Then I saw Blackfish and it opened my eyes. I started casually researching the consciousness of animals. It wasn\u2019t until touring an animal research facility conducting medical device testing on dogs that I realized I want to be deliberately mindful of what is necessary and unnecessary when it comes to our interactions with animals.\n\nI wasn\u2019t aware of the AZA before the responses here. I spent a good chunk of time reading through their accreditation standards and recommendations and it doesn\u2019t change how I feel in the slightest. In fact, reading their care manual for gorillas reinforced my beliefs. Let\u2019s face it - gorillas, elephants, big cats, penguins, etc. just don\u2019t fuckin belong in a zoo in Detroit, Michigan. Hence why they gave away their elephants on ethical grounds (only once they were aging and arthritic).\n\nPersonally, I like the ideas of natural history museums, nature centers, and national parks best. Requiring more research - sanctuaries, refuges, etc. Farms are a topic of discussion for another day, I suppose, given that so many are horrible to their animals/product. And yes, as my son gets older, documentaries will become important.","poster_id":"t2_fgyhxphu","lang":""},{"comment_count":646,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":false,"created_at":1636865616,"title":"Three snow leopards die of COVID-19 at Nebraska zoo","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qtidpb","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":7202,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_afk4t","lang":""},{"comment_count":256,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637330896,"title":"this zoo has an area where you can play tug of war with a lion","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qxgyky","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":7359,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_dv6prqcb","lang":""},{"comment_count":303,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":false,"created_at":1636300587,"title":"TIL that many birds do not breed very well in small flocks and that Zoos use mirrors to help increase reproduction.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qorbr0","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":25828,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_foii5v13","lang":""},{"comment_count":112,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637632742,"title":"Aardwolf in the Cincinnati zoo, it's the world's smallest Hyena and feeds exclusively on insects, and actively detests meat unless softened or well cooked.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_r02119","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":13428,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_8giy73r2","lang":""},{"comment_count":151,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637328331,"title":"Roland, a 4,000 pound Elephant Seal interacting with his keeper at the Berlin Zoo, circa 1930\u2019s","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qxg5oj","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":12495,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_twguw5m","lang":""},{"comment_count":323,"sentiment_score":"Neutral","has_embedded_media":true,"created_at":1637302718,"title":"Let's Build Zoo sold 99% of copies on Steam, only 1% in EGS, according to the dev.","platform":"reddit","sentiment_confidence":0,"post_id":"t3_qx9zjx","top_comments":[],"positive_votes":1896,"text":"","poster_id":"t2_h1i22","lang":""},{"like_count":"5483","created_at":"2021-11-28T13:40:29.000Z","text":"zoo labaikallah humma labaik......\nhttps://t.co/PIpCNvoFvE","id":"1464952336984395784","reply_count":"92","lang":"in","author_id":"1482552098","quote_count":"126","platform":"twitter"},{"like_count":"9764","created_at":"2021-11-28T07:45:34.000Z","text":"Munawar Faruqi's show was cancelled because of 'Low &amp; Order problems'! \n\nIronically, Motto of Bangalore Police is : 'We Serve, We Protect' https://t.co/8QstH3Aeas","id":"1464863019783970817","reply_count":"324","lang":"en","author_id":"935142655213703168","quote_count":"98","platform":"twitter"},{"like_count":"4","created_at":"2021-11-29T02:42:46.000Z","text":"Zoo ada yg tau namanya?
